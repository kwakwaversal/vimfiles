# Vimfiles
Documentation to remind me of vim shortcuts I use the most frequently, and
some plugins I often use.

N.B., this is no substitution for `!vimtutor`.

# Description
In an attempt to remember the shortcuts I use most often in vim (and forget
most often) this documentation sporadically covers things I find most useful.

I have tried to use vim key notation in these docs. `:help key-notation`.

# Commands
* [Manipulation](manipulation.md)
* [Movement](movement.md)
* [Folding](https://gist.github.com/lestoni/8c74da455cce3d36eb68)

# Help
Vim's help is pretty good. The shortcuts I have found most useful when
navigating something in `:help` are:

* `<C-]>` follow link
* `<C-T>` go back to previous topic
