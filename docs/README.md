# Playground
Playground to remind me of vim shortcuts

N.B., this is no substitution for `!vimtutor`.

# Description
In an attempt to remember the shortcuts I use most often in vim (and forget
most often) I have created a playground subdirectory which includes text files
for different vim commands.

I have tried to use vim key notation in these docs. `:help key-notation`.

# Commands
* [Manipulation](playground/manipulation.md)
* [Movement](playground/movement.md)

# Help
Vim's help is pretty good. The shortcuts I have found most useful when
navigating something in `:help` are:

* `<C-]>` follow link
* `<C-T>` go back to previous topic
